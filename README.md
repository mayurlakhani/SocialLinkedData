# SocialLinkedData Project
What is Solid?
Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.
What does Solid offer?
Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.

At a glance, here is what Solid offers...
1. True data ownership
Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it. By decoupling content from the application itself, users are now able to do so.
2. Modular design
Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor lock-in, seamlessly switching between apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social connections.
3. Reusing existing Data
Developers will be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps.
What’s happening now?
We are pleased to note that a new start-up, Inrupt, Inc, will be putting its own effort into the Solid open source technology and the Solid movement.

Inrupt is building a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid’s success and protect the integrity of the next phase of the web. Its mission is to restore rightful ownership of data back to every web user and unleash a new wave of innovation - for developers, for business, for everyone.
